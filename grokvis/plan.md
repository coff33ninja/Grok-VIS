# Comprehensive Plan for Wake Word Detection and TTS Functionality

## Plan:

1. **Fix Unresolved Import in `tts_manager.py`**:
   - Ensure that the `sounddevice` library is installed in the environment. If not, install it using `pip install sounddevice`.

2. **Consolidate the `speak` Function**:
   - Remove the redundant implementation of the `speak` function in `speech.py` and ensure it calls the `speak` function from `tts_manager.py` to synthesize speech properly.

3. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Enhance error messages in the `speak` function of `tts_manager.py` to provide more specific feedback on what went wrong during synthesis or playback.

4. **Update Wake Word Model Path**:
   - In `speech.py`, ensure that the wake word model path is dynamically set or configurable, rather than hardcoded. This will prevent issues if the model is moved or renamed.

5. **Review and Test Wake Word Detection**:
   - Verify that the wake word detection setup in `setup_wakeword.py` is functioning correctly. Ensure that the model is correctly downloaded, extracted, and referenced in `speech.py`.

6. **Run Tests**:
   - After making the changes, run the existing tests in `tests/test_speech.py` to ensure that the TTS and wakeword detection functionalities are working as expected.

## Follow-Up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.
